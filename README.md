# Hadoop on demand REST API

This project provides the REST API for the hadoop on demand project.

Currently the API allows to deploy the Hadoop clusters in OpenNebula.

It is based on Spring boot and for scaffolding we use [jhipster](http://jhipster.github.io)

To start the application use:
```
mvn spring-boot:run
```
